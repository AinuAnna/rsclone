a little bit about tools, which we used:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js framework, Webpack builder and Bootstrap template library.
Development environment - Visual Studio Code. Database - Firebase.

disadvantage of database - you should pay for some operations and functions.

the rest of the development tools were easy to use and there were no problems with them.
