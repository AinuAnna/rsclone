🔮a little bit about tools, which we used:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js framework
- Webpack builder
- Bootstrap template library.
- Database - Firebase.

💔disadvantage of database - you should pay for some operations and functions.

💖the rest of the development tools were easy to use and there were no problems with them.
